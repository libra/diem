    /// # Explanation of the Algorithm
    ///
    /// We have an "infinite" bitvector. The `min_nonce` tells us the starting
    /// index of the window. The window size is the size of the bitmask we can
    /// represent in a 128-bit wide bitmap. The `seq_nonce` that is sent represents
    /// setting a bit at index `seq_nonce` in this infinite bitvector. Because of
    /// this, if the same `seq_nonce` is passed in multiple times, that bit will be
    /// set, and we can signal an error. In order to represent
    /// the `seq_nonce` the window we are looking at must be shifted so that
    /// `seq_nonce` lies within that 128-bit window and, since the `min_nonce`
    /// represents the left-hand-side of this window, it must be increased to be no
    /// less than `seq_nonce - 128`.
    ///
    /// The process of shifting window will invalidate other transactions that
    /// have a `seq_nonce` number that are to the "left" of this window (i.e., less
    /// than `min_nonce`) since it cannot be represented in the current window, and the
    /// window can only move forward and never backwards.
    ///
    /// In order to prevent shifting this window over too much at any one time, a
    /// `jump_limit` is imposed. If a `seq_nonce` is provided that would cause the
    /// `min_nonce` to need to be increased by more than the `jump_limit` this will
    /// cause a failure.
    ///
    /// # Some Examples
    ///
    /// Let's say we start out with a clean `SlidingNonce` published under `account`,
    /// this will look like this:
    /// ```
    /// 000000000000000000...00000000000000000000000000000...

    /// # Example 1:
    ///
    /// Let's see what happens when we call`SlidingNonce::try_record_nonce(account, 8)`:
    ///
    /// 1. Determine the bit position w.r.t. the current window:
    ///     ```
    ///     bit_pos = 8 - min_nonce ~~~ 8 - 0 = 8
    ///     ```
