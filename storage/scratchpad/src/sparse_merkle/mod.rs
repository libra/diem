//! This module implements an in-memory Sparse Merkle Tree that is similar to what we use in
//! storage to represent world state. This tree will store only a small portion of the state -- the
//! part of accounts that have been modified by uncommitted transactions. For example, if we
//! execute a transaction T_i on top of committed state and it modified account A, we will end up
//! having the following tree:
//! ```text
//!              S_i
//!             /   \
//!            o     y
//!           / \
//!          x   A
//! ```
//! where A has the new state of the account, and y and x are the siblings on the path from root to
//! A in the tree.
//!
//! This Sparse Merkle Tree is immutable once constructed. If the next transaction T_{i+1} modified
//! another account B that lives in the subtree at y, a new tree will be constructed and the
//! structure will look like the following:
//! ```text
//!                 S_i        S_{i+1}
//!                /   \      /       \
//!               /     y   /          \
//!              / _______/             \
//!             //                       \
//!            o                          y'
//!           / \                        / \
//!          x   A                      z   B
//! ```
//!
//! Using this structure, we are able to query the global state, taking into account the output of
//! uncommitted transactions. For example, if we want to execute another transaction T_{i+1}', we
//! can use the tree S_i. If we look for account A, we can find its new value in the tree.
//! Otherwise, we know the account does not exist in the tree, and we can fall back to storage. As
//! another example, if we want to execute transaction T_{i+2}, we can use the tree S_{i+1} that
//! has updated values for both account A and B.
//!
//! Each version of the tree holds a strong reference (an Arc<Node>) to its root as well as one to
//! its base tree (S_i is the base tree of S_{i+1} in the above example). The root node in turn,
//! recursively holds all descendant nodes created in the same version, and weak references
//! (a Weak<Node>) to all descendant nodes that was created from previous versions.
//! With this construction:
//!     1. Even if a reference to a specific tree is dropped, the nodes belonging to it won't be
//! dropped as long as trees depending on it still hold strong references to it via the chain of
//! "base trees".
//!     2. Even if a tree is not dropped, when nodes it created are persisted to DB, all of them
//! and those created by its previous versions can be dropped, which we express by calling "prune()"
//! on it which replaces the strong references to its root and its base tree with weak references.
//!     3. We can hold strong references to recently accessed nodes that have already been persisted
//! in an LRU flavor cache for less DB reads.
//!
//! This Sparse Merkle Tree serves a dual purpose. First, to support a leader based consensus
//! algorithm, we need to build a tree of transactions like the following:
//! ```text
//! Committed -> T5 -> T6  -> T7
//!              └---> T6' -> T7'
//!                    └----> T7"
//! ```
//! Once T5 is executed, we will have a tree that stores the modified portion of the state. Later
//! when we execute T6 on top of T5, the output of T5 can be visible to T6.
//!
//! Second, given this tree representation it is straightforward to compute the root hash of S_i
//! once T_i is executed. This allows us to verify the proofs we need when executing T_{i+1}.
